# Plinko !

## Aim

In this I have made the Plinko Game woth real life physics and functionality thus, it will end in a bellman;s curve.

## Language, Coding Style and Procedure

In this Project I have used Javascript with the object oriented style where i had made 3 classes about the Peg, Plinko and the Bucket, where as the features and function of the peg and plinko i same i have used inheritance. I have added arrays which store the plinkos, pegs and boundaries and display them using a loop
